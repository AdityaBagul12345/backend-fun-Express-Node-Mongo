variable we change values.
constants we cannot change its value.
var means we can change the value or variable and const means we can not change its value.
what is let ? => it is also used to create variable.
hoisting => variables and functions are hoisted which means their declaration is moved on top of the code.
means we can access functions and variables which creating it first.
example : - var a;      //this is declaration.
            a = 10;     //this is initialization.

            var a = : // undefined if value not give to variabale. 
            udefinded means no value and not defined means variable is not defined.
// TYPES IN JS 
primitive and reference.
primitive types are immutable
1.Number
2.String

7.BigInt(ES2020)

//Aisi koi bhi values jo copy karne par real copy nahi hota but main value ka 
refenrence pass ho jata hai use refenrence values kehte hai .. 
Aur jiska values copy karne par real copy ho jaye vo primitive hoti hai..   

Reference - 
reference types are mutable.
1.Array[]
2.Objects{}
3.()
4.function
5.Date
7.Set
8.Map

// Conditinals
if-else
